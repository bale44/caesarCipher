This is my first project called Caesar Cipher. I'm using JavaScript, HTML, CSS in this project. 

HOW DOES IT WORK?


Write a sentence, word or letter in an input (do not write any spaces, numbers or special characters) and click a button. After this you will get a new encrypted string shifted by 13 letters. Numbers will not be converted.
